#### _This program is a quiz app built with arrays. September 2020_

#### By _**Elizabeth Eymann**_

## Description

_This project comes from teamtreehouse.com. In this program, I put my knowledge of arrays into practice. First, I use a multidimensional array to hold questions and answers. Second, I store the number of questions answered correctly in a variable. Third, I use a loop to cycle through each question, then:
    - Present each question to the user
    - Compare the user's response to answer in the array
    - If the response matches the answer, the number of correctly
      answered questions increments by 1.
Fourth, I push the question(s) of the correct answer(s) to an array named 'correct', and the question(s) of the incorrect answer(s) to an array called 'incorrect'. Finally, using a function, I display the number of correct answers to the user, including which questions the user got correct, and which ones the user got wrong._
