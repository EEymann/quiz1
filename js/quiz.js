// 1. Create a multidimensional array to hold quiz questions and answers

const questions = [
  ['How many planets are in the Solar System?', '8'],
  ['How many continents are there?', '7'],
  ['How many legs does an insect have?', '6'],
  ['What year was JavaScript created?', '1995']
];

// 2. Store the number of questions answered correctly


/*
  3. Use a loop to cycle through each question
      - Present each question to the user
      - Compare the user's response to answer in the array
      - If the response matches the answer, the number of correctly
        answered questions increments by 1
*/


// 4. Display the number of correct answers to the user
